This is a project that continues the work from my [sample JRPG](https://github.com/wholetonegames/panda3d-jrpg). This has also been abandoned and is in the public domain now. This project started back in March 30th and it was abandoned on 1st of September 2019

To run this game you must install Panda3D first:
https://www.panda3d.org/

Then type into your command line:
`python game_main.py`
